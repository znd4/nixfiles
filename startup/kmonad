#!/sbin/openrc-run
#
# NOTE: This is a service for the openrc init system.
#
# How to use this service:
#
# 1. Place this file in the `/etc/init.d/' directory
#
# 2. Start the service
#
#      rc-service kmonad start
#
# 3. If everything works as intended, add service to default runlevel as it will
#    run after boot runlevel
#
#      rc-update add kmonad default
#
# Note that any X11-specific functionality has to be placed in an
# appropriate place (e.g. `~/.xinitrc'), as the service will execute
# _before_ the X server is started.
#
# The paths below should be absolute paths.
