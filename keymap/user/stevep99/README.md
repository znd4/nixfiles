Colemak-DH layout with Extend
=============================


In this folder are _kmonad_ configuration files for the [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) layout. Both ANSI and ISO keyboards are supported, they are similar except the mapping for Z, which occupies the ISO key where available.

Also included is an [Extend layer](https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/extend.html) which is activated via the CapsLock key. The Extend layer is similar to [DreymaR's original](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2014-extend-extra-extreme/), but with some modifications.

There is also a symbols layer allowing you to type common characters such as brackets using more convenient home-row keys. Also on this layer is a numeric keypad on the right hand. This symbols layer is not enabled by default. To enable it on the AltGr key for example, replace "altgr" with "@sym" in the main output layer.
