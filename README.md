Welcome to KMonad, a keyboard remapping utility for Linux and Windows.

The docs are not yet completed, but here they are anyways:

- [configuration syntax](doc/syntax.md)
- [possible issues](doc/issues.md)
- [Windows limitation](doc/why_windows_why.md)

Get started by copying and adapting configs from [the template directory](template/)
